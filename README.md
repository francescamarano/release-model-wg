# WordPress Release Model Working Group


The topic of the release cadence has been brought up multiple times over the past year:

- The original post about [Major and Minor Version Release Cadence](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/27/major-and-minor-version-release-cadence/)– February 27, 2019
- Recap of [Devchat after the hour: November 20](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/11/25/devchat-after-the-hour-november-20) – November 20, 2019
- Tentative Release Calendar 2020-2021– November 21, 2019 [check the comments](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/11/21/tentative-release-calendar-2020-2021/)

There seems to be a strong will to increase the number of releases per year and some exploratory work has been already done by multiple sources. The goal of the group is to put together all the things that have been done so far and continue to **research and document**


By documenting the existing release process, the group can:
- Evaluate the technical changes needed to speed up the release process
- Evaluate if those changes are doable with the existing resources and tools

The end result will be a few factual, non-opinionated documents which outline the above.
